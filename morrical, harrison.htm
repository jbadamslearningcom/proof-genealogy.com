      <br>
      <i>Portrait and Biographical Record of Kankakee County, Illinois, 1893</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Harrison Morrical</b>, residing on 
      Section 31, Otto Township, is a well-known and enterprising 
      agriculturalist.&nbsp; He was born in Darke County, Ohio, on the 26th of 
      November, 1835, and is a son of Col. Clark Morrical, a native of the Green 
      Mountain State.&nbsp; The paternal grandfather of our subject, John 
      Morrical, moved from Virginia to Ohio, becoming one of the pioneers of 
      Darke County.&nbsp; When he settled in that portion of the State, the 
      county was a wilderness and heavily timbered.&nbsp; On arriving at 
      maturity, Clark Morrical wedded Sarah Pense, who was born in Preble 
      County, Ohio.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that State for many years he was a farmer, 
      after which, moving to Indiana, he operated farms in Henry and Fulton 
      Counties.&nbsp; About 1852 he settled in Kankakee County, Ill., and was 
      one of the earlier pioneers of what is now Otto Township.&nbsp; He opened 
      up a farm and spent a number of years in this locality.&nbsp; In 1856 he 
      went to Indiana to settle up some business affairs and there died.&nbsp; 
      His remains lie buried in Tippecanoe.&nbsp; While in Ohio be became a 
      member of the militia and was promoted to the rank of Colonel.&nbsp; After 
      surviving her husband for many years, the wife and mother died in the 
      residence of her son and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery, at Chebanse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our subject is second in order of birth in the family 
      of four sons and three daughters.&nbsp; The oldest of the family, Adam, 
      was an early settler of this county and here died; Phoebe is the widow of 
      Alexander Miller, of Otto Township; Elias carries on a farm in Indiana; 
      Eliza Ann died when twelve years of age; Lewis is a farmer of this county; 
      Amanda, and Sarah, now deceased, buried in Evergreen Cemetery at Chebanse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The early days of our subject were passed in Ohio, and 
      when a young man he came to Kankakee County.&nbsp; He assisted his father 
      in opening up a farm, and after the death of the latter took charge of the 
      homestead and business.&nbsp; For some years he remained on the farm and 
      then rented a place nearby, which he afterwards bought and which was 
      located on Section 6.&nbsp; This property was raw prairie, with no 
      improvements upon it.&nbsp; With untiring energy he proceeded to cultivate 
      it, and built fences and necessary farm buildings.&nbsp; He also planted a 
      large grove, which is one of the largest in the township.&nbsp; In 1891, 
      Mr. Morrical sold the farm, which has upon it a fine orchard, grown under 
      his preserving care, and invested the proceeds in one hundred and eighty 
      acres, the farm on which he now resides.&nbsp; This tract is arable land 
      and is well cultivated.&nbsp; He has a good residence, barns and 
      outbuildings, and is considered one of the most enterprising and 
      well-to-do farmers of Otto Township.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Wells County, Ind., on the 25th of April, 1875, was 
      celebrated the marriage of Mr. Morrical and Miss Eliza Ann Houdyshell.&nbsp; 
      The lady was born in Ohio, reared to womanhood in Indiana and is a 
      daughter of David Houdyshell, one of the pioneers and early settlers of 
      Wells County, Ind.&nbsp; Five children have graced the union of Mr. and 
      Mrs. Morrical, as follows:&nbsp; Oscar, Elmore, William, Tolfy, and 
      Leslie.&nbsp; With the exception of the youngest, the children are all 
      attending school.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since becoming a voter, Mr. Morrical has been 
      identified with the Democratic party.&nbsp; His fellow citizens have 
      honored him a number of times by electing him to fill various positions of 
      responsibility.&nbsp; He has given of his means and influence to the 
      support of the public schools and in company with Mr. Kendall got up a 
      petition for the division of the old school district.&nbsp; Thus was 
      established the school district in which he now resides and of it he was 
      elected the first director, and also the first clerk.&nbsp; He has also 
      served as a member of the school board for several terms.&nbsp; Both Mr. 
      and Mrs. Morrical are influential members of the Methodist Episcopal 
      church and it was through the influence of our subject that the church and 
      Sunday-school were established here.&nbsp; He is well known in this and 
      adjoining counties as a man of integrity and upright character and by his 
      fellow citizens he is held in the highest regard.<br>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MORRICAL, HARRISON</b>--It is 
      doubtful if any satisfaction which visits the toilers of earth is 
      comparable to that experienced by the farmer who has earned means and 
      influence, who at last is able to lay aside his implements, to take no 
      thought of the responsibilities of the seasons, to fold occasionally his 
      toil-hardened hands, and out of the fullness of his gratitude and 
      consciousness of well doing, watch kindly and sympathetically those who 
      are succeeding him in the race.&nbsp; This class of men, who comprise the 
      backbone of this great republic, necessarily must have useful lessons to 
      impart to the inquiring.&nbsp; One of the greatest of these is that hard 
      work, directed by an intelligent and practical mind alone is responsible 
      for genuine success.&nbsp; This opinion is emphatically endorsed by 
      Harrison Morrical, one of the early settlers and&nbsp; and prosperous 
      farmers of Otto Township, who has indelibly stamped his worth upon its 
      agricultural, educational, and social conditions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born among humble surroundings on a farm in Darke 
      County, Ohio, November 26, 1835, Mr. Morrical is of a German ancestry, his 
      family having been established in America by his paternal great 
      grandfather, who came from Germany and settled in Virginia.&nbsp; Clark 
      Morrical, son of John Morrical, was born in Virginia, moved in later life 
      with his father to Darke County, Ohio, still later settling in Indiana, 
      and in 1855, locating on the farm in Kankakee County.&nbsp; When his death 
      occurred in November, 1864, he was the father of nine children:&nbsp; 
      Jacob, Nancy, Andrew, Solomon, Elizabeth, Oroha, Margaret, Washington, and 
      Clark.&nbsp; Clark, the father of Harrison, was born in Virginia, May 5, 
      1814, and when a boy moved with his parents to Darke County, Ohio.&nbsp; 
      In February, 1834, he married Sarah Pence, a native of Preble County, 
      Ohio, and born March 7, 1812.&nbsp; Mr. Morrical was a man of energy and 
      resource, but a disposition to wander prevented the accomplishment of much 
      in any one place.&nbsp; For several years he was a colonel in the Ohio 
      state militia, and was filling that office at the time of his removal to 
      Henry County, Ind., in 1842.&nbsp; Later on he lived in Randolph, Fulton, 
      Marshall, and LaPorte counties, Ind., and in 1855 settled on the farm in 
      Otto township, Kankakee County, Ill., where he spent the balance of his 
      life.&nbsp; His death occurred while on a business trip to Marshall 
      County, Ind., in 1857.&nbsp; His wife, who survived him ten years, was the 
      mother of nine children:&nbsp; Adam, deceased; Harrison; Phoebe; Eliza A., 
      deceased; Elias; Aaron, deceased; Lewis; Alameda; and Sarah, deceased.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harrison Morrical came to Kankakee County with his 
      parents in 1855, at that time having twenty years to his credit.&nbsp; His 
      growing strength had been severely tried on the various farms his father 
      had occupied, and his schooling had been meager, and irregularly acquired.&nbsp; 
      In his new environment he was glad of any occupation which promised even 
      fair returns, and he worked by the day or month for the surrounding 
      farmers, receiving twelve dollars a month.&nbsp; His first purchase of 
      land cost him ten dollars an acre, and consisted of a forty-acre tract on 
      section 6, Otto township, Kankakee county.&nbsp; Later he bought an 
      adjoining&nbsp; forty acres, paying twenty dollars an acre.&nbsp; Tiring 
      of the country and longing for the excitement of city life, he worked in 
      Chicago during the fall and winter preceding the great fire of 1871, 
      returning then to his farm, well content with the promise of sure, if 
      slow, results .&nbsp; Assured of a comfortable income at last, he married 
      Eliza A. Houdyshell, April 25, 1875, his wife having been born in Darke 
      County, Ohio, March 21, 1850, a daughter of David and Nancy A. Householder 
      Houdyshell, natives of Ohio.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Houdyshell spent the last 
      years in Wells County, Ind., of which they were early settlers.&nbsp; They 
      had ten children:&nbsp; Sarah, Elizabeth, Isaac, Anthony, Henry, Mary, 
      David, William, Jacob, and Andrew.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Morrical is one of the oldest settlers in Otto 
      township, and at the time he settled there it was wild prairie, infested 
      with wolves and rattlesnakes, and wild game of all kinds was abundant.&nbsp; 
      The improvement of the pioneer farm in Otto township was accomplished at 
      great sacrifice of strength, and often of the comforts of life.&nbsp; The 
      early days witnessed many extremes of economy in order to get a start.&nbsp; 
      The little house in which Mr. Morrical started housekeeping formerly 
      adorned the premises of his neighbor, Adam Kertner, and became his through 
      the exchange of a yoke of oxen.&nbsp; The moving of this house several 
      miles to the neighboring farm was&nbsp; great undertaking, but the 
      Morricals found it comfortable for many years.&nbsp; In March 1892, Mr. 
      Morrical moved from his farm to the one he now owns and which had been 
      purchased the previous fall.&nbsp; He owns three hundred and five acres, 
      splendidly improved, as comfortable as a home, and productive as a farm, 
      as any in the township.&nbsp; His enterprise has brought within the reach 
      of his family the conveniences now associated with the progressive and 
      prosperous localities, and his many favors in the past, and continuous 
      courtesy to neighbors and associates, finds him the recipient, in his 
      later years, of a wealth of friendship and good wishes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not the least of Mr. Morrical's causes for gratitude are his 
      five strong and capable sons, all of whom have been trained to systematic 
      farming, and give promise of maintaining the dignity and worthiness of his 
      name.&nbsp; His oldest born, Oscar, whose birth occurred January 13, 1877, 
      married Nettie Anderson, and lives on one of his father's farms; Elmore, 
      born April 9, 1879, married Nora Sheehan, and owns a farm in Kankakee 
      County; William, born October 6, 1881, is unmarried and lives with his 
      parents; Tolfy, born June 5, 1884, also lives at home; and Leslie, born 
      July 20, 1890, assists with the management of the home place.&nbsp; Mr. 
      Morrical has never taken an active part in politics, and though a democrat 
      by preference, invariably votes for the man best qualified to serve the 
      public welfare.&nbsp; He has been the stanch friend of education, and as 
      the first school director, was instrumental in securing the erection of 
      the first school building in the district.&nbsp; His social and religious 
      influence has been no less emphatic, and he was foremost in starting the 
      first Sunday school and church in his township.&nbsp; He has been a 
      liberal contributor to all worthy causes in the locality, and has 
      encouraged by precept and example the things which tend to cheerfulness, 
      temperance, and prosperity.<!--mstheme--></font></td>
