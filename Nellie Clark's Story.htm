      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Case Wadley worked for 
      Gurdon Hubbard in the fur trade at Danville.&nbsp; Then Wadley moved to 
      the Bourbonnais Trading Post.&nbsp; Wadley’s wife died and he opened a 
      farm just south of Waldron in 1833 and married Mrs. Maria Boardman.&nbsp; 
      Maria was eleven years younger than Case.&nbsp; They had six children plus 
      his son, Jasper, which made seven.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Case’s brother, Sylvester, who was 
      born in New York, and wife, Elizabeth, born in Pennsylvania and five year 
      old than Sylvester, were still in Ohio where they go married.&nbsp; They had 
      Mary Margaret in about 1837.&nbsp; They then moved to Indiana and had their 
      second daughter, Sylvia about a year and half later.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They moved their family to Illinois to be near 
      his brother Case who was by Aroma Park on a farm.&nbsp; Sylvester is a cooper 
      by trade so he may have lived in the nearby settlement by the Iroquois 
      River.&nbsp; This was part of Iroquois County at this time until 1854 when 
      Kankakee County was formed.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the same time, John and Sarah Clark arrived 
      and bought 160 acres next to the Beaver Creek Cemetery then known as the 
      Jones Cemetery.&nbsp; They had three sons and a daughter.&nbsp; The daughter Mahala 
      remained in Indiana.&nbsp; Sons William, Bradford, and Orrin came to Papineau 
      township which became part of Iroquois County.&nbsp; By the 1850’s, Sylvia 
      Wadley and O. B. Clark who lived 6 miles south were acquainted and on 
      January 1st, 1856, 18 year old Sylvia and 27 year old Orrin were married.&nbsp; 
      In 1858, they had a daughter named Lydia.&nbsp; Father-in-law John Clark died 
      suddenly that same year.&nbsp; The next year O.B. and Sylvia have another 
      daughter born to them.&nbsp; They call her Alice.&nbsp; At this same time, 
      mother-in-law Sarah is living with them.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the winter of 60-61 baby 
      Alice died.&nbsp; Sylvia had been pregnant since last summer.&nbsp; Her baby boy, 
      who they named Major, was born on April 22nd of 1861.&nbsp; Twelve days later, 
      O. B. Clark, the new baby’s father, died.&nbsp; He was 32.</p>
      <p align="right">Stephen Benjamin rented the 160 acres of Clark farm 
      ground through Nelson Bancroft, a 33 year old farmer from just south in 
      Martinton township who was the administrator for O. B. Clark’s estate.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sylvia apparently liked the new farmer for she 
      married Stephen in 1863 and they continued to farm the Clark place.&nbsp; The 
      next year Stephen and Sylvia have their first daughter that they named 
      Emaline.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following year seven-year-old Lydia, a daughter to O. B. 
      Clark died on the 2nd of July 1865.&nbsp; Now we have in the household Sylvia 
      and Stephen with O. B.’s son Major and their daughter Emaline.&nbsp; 
      Mother-in-law Sarah or Sally moved out to her son William’s house for a 
      year or so after O. B. died.&nbsp; She also lived in Indiana with her daughter 
      Mahala for three years then she lived again in Papineau township with her 
      3rd son Bradford Clark.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1867 Stephen and Sylvia have their 2nd child a 
      daughter named Caroline.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family feud is in full progress by now and on 
      the 8th of October, 1870, Sally Clark sued her daughter-in-law Sylvia 
      Wadley Clark Benjamin for support from the Clark farm, which she claimed 
      she had not received since her son O. B. died.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most court cases, it lingered on and on.&nbsp; 
      Before its conclusion, Stephen Benjamin, a 38-year-old man died suddenly 
      on the 10th of September 1872.&nbsp; The following year in November, Judge 
      Chamberlin made a decision for the case.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the case was settled, Sylvia married David 
      Brown on June 11th, 1873.&nbsp; A month or so after the case is over, 1874 
      begins and is an eventful year.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine months after Sylvia married David Brown, he 
      too died in March of 1874.&nbsp; Two months after husband David’s death, Sally 
      Clark, mother-in-law from the first marriage dies in May 1874.&nbsp; The 
      following month Sylvia sues her son Major Clark now 13 as a result of the 
      court decision and the deaths of O. B. and his mother Sally.&nbsp; The results 
      of this case are that Sylvia got one third of the land, the house to live 
      in, and $1000 for Lydia, the living daughter, at the time O. B. died.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sylvia’s mother Elizabeth died _____.&nbsp; Her father 
      moves in with his brother Case Wadley by Aroma Park.&nbsp; A new generation is 
      about to begin as Sylvia’s family now numbers four children, Major Clark 
      from her first marriage, Emiline, Caroline, and son Levi from the marriage 
      to Stephen Benjamin.&nbsp; On Dec. 31st, News Year’s Eve, 1878, daughter 
      Emiline, who now calls herself Emily, married Horace J. Clark.&nbsp; She must 
      have listed her age as 16 to the Justice of the Peace who married them 
      when in reality, she was 14 years old at that time.&nbsp; Her new husband 
      Horace is 9 or 10 years older than Sylvia and a first cousin to her half 
      brother Major Clark.&nbsp; He was born in Indiana to Wm. B. and Sarah Ann Clark 
      and had 6 siblings.&nbsp; Wm. B. lived in Papineau township.&nbsp; By 1880 Sylvia is 
      living on a farm with William Dunning, Chancy Smith and his 8-year-old son 
      George.&nbsp; Dunning, who was retired, owns the farm, on the North edge of 
      Iroquois, that once belonged to Gurdon Hubbard who used it as a fur 
      trading post at what was then called Bunkwum.&nbsp; Smith was farming the 
      ground and Sylvia was keeping house for the men. </p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She must have liked this farmer too since she 
      married him on the 2nd of March 1880.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearby, daughter Emily, her husband Horace, and 
      8-month-old baby boy Sylvester, probably named after Grandpa Sylvester 
      Wadley, lived in Concord township.&nbsp; Meanwhile about 25 miles to the 
      northwest in Newton County Indiana and Jackson township, Sylvia’s children 
      Carrie and Major are living with William David and Henry Wolf.&nbsp; Carrie is 
      13 and keeping house, Henry is 16 and Major is 19.&nbsp; William David who is 
      23 is the son of William and Jemima David whose daughter Eliza married Sid 
      Benjamin, brother of Stephen Benjamin, Sylvia’s 2nd husband.&nbsp; Stephen’s 
      father Elijah died in 1882.&nbsp; That same year Emma and Horace have their 
      second son Arthur.&nbsp; Horace and Emma moved to Aroma Park where he was known 
      as the village blacksmith.&nbsp; By 1893 Emma, calling herself Nellie, was 
      having a daughter, Gertrude, running a business in Champaign and getting a 
      divorce from Horace J. Clark.&nbsp; By 1893, Nellie moved her business to 367 
      S. West Avenue, Kankakee.&nbsp; Former husband Horace Clark married Elva 
      Jacobus in 1896.&nbsp; She died in 1918 and he in 1920 and they are buried in 
      Aroma Park.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur and Gertrude live with Grandmother Sylvia 
      Smith in 1900.&nbsp; Sylvia died in Kankakee on&nbsp; _________.&nbsp; In 1918, Nell’s 
      children, Arthur and Gertrude were sent to Joliet Prison for larceny.&nbsp; 
      Gertie worked with her mother and was arrested many times.&nbsp; Levi Benjamin 
      had his problems with bribery, arson, insurance fraud and illegal liquor.&nbsp; 
      Nellie died on the 28th of April 1942.&nbsp; Her son Sylvester died in 1960.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marie Clark who was born on the 2nd of May 1888 
      in Austria, died on the 30th of November 1968.&nbsp; Cause of death is listed 
      as extreme obesity.&nbsp; She was Nell’s daughter-in-law.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m sure there is more such as grandparent’s 
      deaths, Wadleys and Benjamins and many cousins from Sylvia’s sister, O. 
      B.’s brothers, Stephen’s family and information from Aroma Cemetery. </p>
